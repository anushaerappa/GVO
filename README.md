# GVO of agricultural commodities

## Objective: 
Analyze Karnataka's agricultural growth (2004-2021) with a focus on high/low-value crops, uncovering trends and challenges for insightful understanding.

• Number of commodities used for analysis=74

• Time period= 2004-21

• Data= Value of Output (in lakhs thousands)

• Source: NSO Data


### GVO
It includes both the products and services that the business sells to the market, and the products and services that the business uses internally

GVO = Total sales + Change in stock   (or)

GVO = Value of net output(GDP) + Intermediate consumption (or)

in simple terms,

GVO = Value of production + Value of input used in production process 

### Calculations invovled

1.Growth Rate(GR)

Refer to the percentage change of a specific variable within a specific time period.
  Growth rates can be positive or negative, depending on whether the size of the variable is increasing or decreasing over     time.

 GR = ((final_value / initial_value) ** (1 / t)) - 1

 
 
2.Mean Percentage Change(MPC)

It’s a way of measuring how much a quantity changes over time, relative to its initial value.

MPC = %change.mean()

Used this metrics to find the trend direction of the dataset.



3.Total Gross Value(TGV)

 It is sum of gross values from 2004 to 2021.
 It is used to measure the contribution of a particular commodity to overall economic output.

 Used this metric classify crops into low value crops and high value crops.
 

 ## Basis of analysis
 Percentage change = 0 is considered for trend direction. 
 
 Mean value of Total Gross Value was taken for classifying crops. 
 
 Trend analysis - % change > 0 → Increasing trend                                                                           
                  % change < 0 → Decreasing trend
                  
  Crop Classification – Total Gross Value > 2018364.5 → High Value Crop  
  Total Gross Value < 2018364.5 → Low Value Crop

  
## Results
High value crops decreasing trend(HVCD) = 0

High value crops increasing trend(HVCI) = 19

Low value crop decreasing trend(LVCD) = 8

Low value crop increasing trend(LVCI) = 47
